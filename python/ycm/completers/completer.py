class Completer( object ):
  """A base class for all Completers in YCM.

  Here's several important things you need to know if you're writing a custom
  Completer. The following are functions that the Vim part of YCM will be
  calling on your Completer:

  ShouldUseNow() is called with the start column of where a potential completion
  string should start and the current line (string) the cursor is on. For
  instance, if the user's input is 'foo.bar' and the cursor is on the 'r' in
  'bar', start_column will be the 0-based index of 'b' in the line. Your
  implementation of ShouldUseNow() should return True if your semantic completer
  should be used and False otherwise.

  This is important to get right. You want to return False if you can't provide
  completions because then the identifier completer will kick in, and that's
  better than nothing.

  Note that it's HIGHLY likely that you want to override the ShouldUseNowInner()
  function instead of ShouldUseNow() directly (although chances are that you
  probably won't have any need to override either). ShouldUseNow() will call
  your *Inner version of the function and will also make sure that the
  completion cache is taken into account. You'll see this pattern repeated
  throughout the Completer API; YCM calls the "main" version of the function and
  that function calls the *Inner version while taking into account the cache.

  The cache is important and is a nice performance boost. When the user types in
  "foo.", your completer will return a list of all member functions and
  variables that can be accessed on the "foo" object. The Completer API caches
  this list. The user will then continue typing, let's say "foo.ba". On every
  keystroke after the dot, the Completer API will take the cache into account
  and will NOT re-query your completer but will in fact provide fuzzy-search on
  the candidate strings that were stored in the cache.

  CandidatesForQueryAsync() is the main entry point when the user types. For
  "foo.bar", the user query is "bar" and completions matching this string should
  be shown. The job of CandidatesForQueryAsync() is to merely initiate this
  request, which will hopefully be processed in a background thread. You may
  want to subclass ThreadedCompleter instead of Completer directly.

  AsyncCandidateRequestReady() is the function that is repeatedly polled until
  it returns True. If CandidatesForQueryAsync() started a background task of
  collecting the required completions, AsyncCandidateRequestReady() would check
  the state of that task and return False until it was completed.

  CandidatesFromStoredRequest() should return the list of candidates. This is
  what YCM calls after AsyncCandidateRequestReady() returns True. The format of
  the result can be a list of strings or a more complicated list of
  dictionaries. See ':h complete-items' for the format, and clang_completer.py
  to see how its used in practice.

  You also need to implement the SupportedFiletypes() function which should
  return a list of strings, where the strings are Vim filetypes your completer
  supports.

  clang_completer.py is a good example of a "complicated" completer that
  maintains its own internal cache and therefore directly overrides the "main"
  functions in the API instead of the *Inner versions. A good example of a
  simple completer that does not do this is omni_completer.py.

  If you're confident your completer doesn't need a background task (think
  again, you probably do) because you can "certainly" furnish a response in
  under 10ms, then you can perform your backend processing in a synchronous
  fashion. You may also need to do this because of technical restrictions (much
  like omni_completer.py has to do it because accessing Vim internals is not
  thread-safe). But even if you're certain, still try to do the processing in a
  background thread. Your completer is unlikely to be merged if it does not,
  because synchronous processing will block Vim's GUI thread and that's a very,
  VERY bad thing (so try not to do it!). Again, you may want to subclass
  ThreadedCompleter instead of Completer directly; ThreadedCompleter will
  abstract away the use of a background thread for you. See
  threaded_completer.py.

  The On* functions are provided for your convenience. They are called when
  their specific events occur. For instance, the identifier completer collects
  all the identifiers in the file in OnFileReadyToParse() which gets called when
  the user stops typing for 2 seconds (Vim's CursorHold and CursorHoldI events).

  One special function is OnUserCommand. It is called when the user uses the
  command :YcmCompleter and is passed all extra arguments used on command
  invocation (e.g. OnUserCommand(['first argument', 'second'])).  This can be
  used for completer-specific commands such as reloading external
  configuration.
  When the command is called with no arguments you should print a short summary
  of the supported commands or point the user to the help section where this
  information can be found.

  Override the Shutdown() member function if your Completer subclass needs to do
  custom cleanup logic on server shutdown."""
